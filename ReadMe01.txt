ActiveX Control Tutorial Part (1 of 3)

====================== IMPORTANT ========================
Because the first file has a EXE extension, I had to 
rename it to "ActiveXTutorial.part1.e_e".
When you decompress it, just rename it back to 
"ActiveX_Tutorial.part1.exe".
==========================================================

Te tutorial is in Microsoft HTML Help format so anyone in 
Windows can open it.

The file got very big (1.2 MB)!! Therefore, I had to 
compress it with WinRAR and had to split it into 3 Parts.

I am sure that you will not regret downloading it!!
